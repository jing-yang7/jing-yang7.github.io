<p>I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia, with a secondary appointment (by courtesy) in the Department of Computer Science. Previously, I was an Assistant and then tenured Associate Professor at the Pennsylvania State University. I received my B.S. from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), and M.S. and PhD degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park, all in Electrical Engineering. </p>
<p>My research interests lie in machine learning, wireless communications and networking, and information theory. Current research topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Transformers and large language models (LLMs)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Privacy-preserving machine learning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Federated learning and distributed/decentralized learning</p>
</li>
<li><p>Machine learning for wireless communications and networking</p>
